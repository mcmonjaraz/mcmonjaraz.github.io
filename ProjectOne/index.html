					<h2 > Pinky and Index </h2>
					<p>
						For the first time ever the famous finger performers Pinky and Index have come together on the big screen to create an unparalleld performance. Both performers wich together add up to over 50 days of working experience in the contemporany figer art performcance have brought there distinc styles and merged them in a unique style they call "Molto Expresso Dedo". The russian conservatory style of Pinky(Acting as Billie) contrasts in a pacific way with the the liberal Argentinian education od Index(performing as Micheal).
